# Commercial License

## Overview

Bayan Flow is dual-licensed to provide flexibility for different use cases:

1. **Open Source License**: Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0) - Free for most uses
2. **Commercial License**: Available for organizations requiring additional terms

## When Do You Need a Commercial License?

### ✅ You DON'T Need a Commercial License If:

- Using the software as-is in your commercial product
- Making modifications and keeping them under MPL-2.0
- Combining the software with proprietary code in a larger work
- Using for internal business purposes
- Embedding in commercial applications with source disclosure

**The MPL-2.0 allows commercial use!** Most companies can use Bayan Flow without a commercial license.

### ⚠️ You MIGHT Want a Commercial License If:

- You need **proprietary modifications** without source disclosure
- You require **liability protection** beyond MPL-2.0's warranty disclaimer
